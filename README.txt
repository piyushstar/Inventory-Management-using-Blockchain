Introduction

One of the major problems faced in respective supply chain industry is the accuracy and authenticity of data regarding inventory. Many inventory management tools and techniques have been adapted throughout the years. Most of the Inventory management systems run an age-old DBMS and linear data entry in quantitative aspect. This is all good until some miscellaneous activity takes place in the source document. Even a negligence of .01 percent can cast an abruptly wrong data that follows the case. Then the investigation would be probed to which point of time the error has taken place. This is again a waste of time, money and other resources for the company. To avoid this most businesses, tend to write of the inconsistency and move on with it. Some data manipulations like these have led to jaw dropping laundering and unethical practices in the recent past. One of the main causes for this scenario to be showcased is the centralization of data. This makes it much simple for forging and falsification of data.
